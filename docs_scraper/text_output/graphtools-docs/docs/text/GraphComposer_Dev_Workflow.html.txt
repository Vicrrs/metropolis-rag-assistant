However, quite often, a custom codelet may also be required to be developed based on specific needs.
This workflow is for custom extension developers. It allows developers to implement new functionality and add business logic to applications through graph.There are two options to for developing extensions and application graphs:Native workstationDeepStream SDK devel container imageWhen developing on native workstation, install pre-requisites for extension generation and build:/opt/nvidia/graph-composer/extension-dev/install_dependencies.shsudoapt-getupdate&&sudoapt-get-yinstalllibtoolautoconfgtk-doc-toolsUsing the DeepStreamSDK development container image. The image has all the dependencies already installed:dockerpullnvcr.io/nvidia/deepstream:7.1-gc-triton-develxhost+dockerrun-it--entrypoint/bin/bash--gpusall--rm--network=host-eDISPLAY=${DISPLAY}-v/tmp/.X11-unix/:/tmp/.X11-unix--privileged-v/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.socknvcr.io/nvidia/deepstream:7.1-gc-triton-develIn both the cases, either commandline or Composer UI can used. To launch composer, run:composerNoteWhen using the Composer from the devel container image, users could have a problem browsing the “/” folder from the file browser, in this case they can just type the file path directly or copy and paste it.Sync Extensions#Before any extension can be built or graph created, extensions from NGC public
repo must be sync’ed. Follow the steps below to sync the extensions:Using commandline#Sync published extensions from NVIDIA Cloud repository using following command:registryreposync-nngc-publicCheck the extensions using following commands:registryextnlistregistrycomplistRefer to theRegistry Command Line Interfacefor more commands.Using Composer UI#Open theRegistrymenu from the menubar at the top and click onSyncRepoSelectngc-publicfrom the drop-down list and click onSyncComposer will report the current status using a progress barOnce the extension sync is complete, composer will display a success message.On clicking close, composer will automatically refresh component list and the
refreshed list can be seen in the component list window on the rightDevelop New Extension#Using commandline#Sample GXF Extension#Graph Composer package provides a useful tool to help create new extensions and components.
The extension-dev project located at/opt/nvidia/graph-composer/extension-dev/helps create the
boiler plate code required to create custom extensions. Check LICENSE.txt for the corresponding licenses.A script has been provided to generate a sample extension with a codelet and a graph to test
the extension within an application. The generated extension contains a single codelet component that
logs a message in the start() and tick() methods once and the graph finishes
execution. To use the script, run the following commands.Generatesampleextension called test with a codelet namedHelloWorld$python3/opt/nvidia/graph-composer/extension-dev/generate_codelet.py\--output_dir/tmp/--extn_nametest--codelet_nameHelloWorld$cd/tmp/testWithin the target directory, the following files are autogenerated: codelet (component),
extension and an application. The BUILD files needed to generate the extension libraries
using bazel build system are also generated.1.2|____WORKSPACE3|____.bazelrc4|____apps5| |____app.yaml6|____extensions7| |____test8| | |____BUILD9| | |____HelloWorld.hpp10| | |____test.cpp11| | |____HelloWorld.cppHeader file - hello_world.hpp#pragma once#include"gxf/std/codelet.hpp"namespacesample{namespacetest{// Logs a message in start() and tick()classHelloWorld:publicnvidia::gxf::Codelet{public:gxf_result_tstart()override;gxf_result_ttick()override;gxf_result_tstop()override{returnGXF_SUCCESS;}};}// namespace test}// namespace samplecpp file - hello_world.cpp#include"HelloWorld.hpp"// NOLINTnamespacesample{namespacetest{gxf_result_tHelloWorld::start(){GXF_LOG_INFO("HelloWorld::start");returnGXF_SUCCESS;}gxf_result_tHelloWorld::tick(){GXF_LOG_INFO("HelloWorld::tick");returnGXF_SUCCESS;}}// namespace test}// namespace sampleextension cpp file - test.cpp#include"HelloWorld.hpp"#include"gxf/std/extension_factory_helper.hpp"GXF_EXT_FACTORY_BEGIN()GXF_EXT_FACTORY_SET_INFO(0xd8629d822909316d,0xa9ee7410c8c1a7b6,"test","A Dummy Example","","1.0.0","NVIDIA");GXF_EXT_FACTORY_ADD(0xd39d70014cab3ecf,0xb397c9d200cf9e8d,sample::test::HelloWorld,nvidia::gxf::Codelet,"Dummy example source codelet.");GXF_EXT_FACTORY_END()Build the extension for both x86 (default) and the aarch64 (jetson) platforms. The tool also generates
aworkspacefile which creates a bazel workspace to compile and execute the extension. It also includes
a target for registering the extension to the local workspace. The extension can then be used from Composer
to create graph or by container builder to deploy the graph.`$cd<extension_path>$bazelbuild...#Forbuildingx86variant$bazelbuild...--config=jetson#Forbuildingjetson(aarch64)variant`Sample GXF Application#The tool also generates a sample application which executes theHelloWorldcodelet 10 times and exits.application yaml file -apps/app.yaml%YAML1.2---dependencies:-extension:testuuid:d8629d82-2909-316d-a9ee-7410c8c1a7b6version:1.0.0---name:sourcecomponents:-name:signaltype:sample::test::HelloWorld-type:nvidia::gxf::CountSchedulingTermparameters:count:10---components:-type:nvidia::gxf::GreedySchedulerparameters:realtime:falsemax_duration_ms:1000000Entities are defined in the yaml file.
