In addition to docker images, it can also push the final image into the cloud for deployment.Container Builder interacts withRegistry: to:Download extensions and other related files into your local system.Copy other required files specified in the config file to generate an intermediate work folder and an optimized dockerfile.Convert archives/packages dependencies and instructions into docker and try to build a minimal sized local image. For optimization, you can easily configure container builder to support multi-stage docker build.Container Builder supports graph installing and container image building on x86 Ubuntu systems. It can also build arm64 images from x86_64 platforms - to do this, you will need to install QEMU andbintutils.Prerequisites#Install right docker versionhttps://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/log into the server which you might need pull/push images. Run:$dockerloginserver:portIf you need NGC images and resources, followhttps://ngc.nvidia.com/setup/api-keyto apply permission and getAPI_KEYtoken. Then run,$dockerloginnvcr.ioSome features (e.g. squash) might need docker experimental support. To enable that, update/etc/docker/daemon.jsonand add{"experimental":true}Then restart docker by running$sudosystemctlrestartdockerIf you want to build ARM docker images from x86_64 platform, then need to installQEMUandbinfmt. OS restart might be needed.$sudoapt-getinstallqemubinfmt-supportqemu-user-static$dockerrun--rm--privilegedmultiarch/qemu-user-static--reset-pyesTo verify if it is working, run$dockerrun--rm-tarm64v8/ubuntuuname-mInstall Graph Composer package. Make surecontainer_builderexecutable binary is installed.Container Builder Features#The image building is based on docker build. Container builder provides different stage models to build the image. There arecompile_stageandclean_stagemodels for users to select. Some features are applicable for one stage only. For more details, see the feature table.Container Builder features#FeaturesDescriptionStage

The config file collects all user settings as a YAML format text file. Briefly to generate a container, users need update the config file and run command line, wheregraph_target_keycan bex86oraarch64$container_builderbuild-cconfig.yaml-dgraph_target_keyContainer image can also be pushed to remote repository using command$container_builderpush-cconfig.yaml-dgraph_target.yamlSee more details of config settings from Configuration Specification. The graph target key corresponds to the graph target configuration, stored in file/opt/nvidia/graph-composer/graph_targets.yaml, which is used by registry during graph install. See registry cli graph install documentation for sample file.The default log print level is INFO and output stream displays on screen. log-level, log-file, and other arguments are used for debug. For more details, refer to help option from the following command$container_builder-hMultiarch Build#Additionally, CB tool can now build multiarch images.

Each config file can have only one control section with key field container_builder: nameContainer dockerfile stage section - All the sections will be converted into dockerfiles. Users can specify multiple stage sections. There are 2 model templates for different stages.clean_stage model: This is the default model if not specified. The output container image must have a clean_stage section as final stage. Users should keep the final stage as clean as possible.compile_stage model: It is used to do some extra work such as build binaries from source code and to install some compile tools. It should be an intermediate stage, users can specify the clean_stage to copy required binaries from compile_stage.NoteYou must store private information safely when building docker images from container builders. Learn more details of docker referencehttps://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/to avoid exposing critical layers to the public.
MSB(Multi-stage build) is one of the best practices to separate internal source code stage and clean public stage. In container builder, users can use compile_stage to quickly start source code compiling and copy results to clean_stage for the final image. More details refer tohttps://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/multistage-build/A Basic Example of Container Builder Configuration#This example has 2 sections with aclean_stagebuild section and a main control section.During stage build:Starts frombase_imageand installs somedebian, python3 packages into the target imageInstalls archivesCopies files from local and other imageFinally do some cleanup and environment settings on output target image.The main control section would install the graph dependencies through registry into the target image. You can specify some build options to control the stage build and finally push the target image into the cloud.Here is the sample code with comments inline.# Container dockerfile Stage build section
