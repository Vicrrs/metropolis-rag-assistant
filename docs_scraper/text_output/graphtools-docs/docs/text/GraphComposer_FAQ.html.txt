How can I get more information on why the operation failed?#The registry logs all of its operations in/tmp/gxf_registry.logfile. You can use this to view the debug logs.How can I change the location of the registry logs?#Currently, registry logs are located at/tmp. You can change this location by setting an environment variable calledTMPDIRto an existing directory.
e.g.$mkdir-p/home/$USER/tmp&&exportTMPDIR=/home/$USER/tmpContainer Builder#In the main control section, why is the field container_builder required?#It is used to distinguish the main control and the stage sections. Any name for container_builder should be ok.In the list of local_copy_files, if src is a folder, Any difference for dst ends with ‘/’ or not?#No. There is no difference fordst. It must be a folder to storesrccontent.What happens if unsupported fields are added into each section of the YAML file?#Container builder would skip all unsupported fields in YAML config. Users should take responsibility to set correct fields and values. For example, ifentrypointis added intocompile_stage, it would be skipped.During container builder installing graphs, sometimes there are unexpected errors happening while downloading manifests or extensions from registry. And once it happens, container builder may return errors again and again. How to clean and restart?#Some timeout errors during extensions downloads in the registry might cause information loss. This could stop container builder to re-add repos into registry. Just restarting the container builder may not solve the issue. When it happens, users need to manually clean up the registry repo and restart container builder again. For example, use cmdlinegxf_registryreporemove--name[repo_name]to remove the repo.
